# Sketchy

## Overview

Sketchy is a (fairly primitive) web-based drawing application. You can make a new sketch, give it a name, draw to your heart's content, and it for later modification. Engage in a level of artistry not seen since the early days of MS Paint!

## Technical Details

Sketchy uses a handful of technologies to do its thing, including

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/)
* [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Todo

* Expand this README file.
* Add more drawing tools.
* Implement user sign-up.
* Host a demo instance on Heroku. (After users are implemented. Because we all know what will happen to a public drawing app on the Internet.)
